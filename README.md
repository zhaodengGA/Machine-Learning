This is a Machine Learning beginning program for learning purpose. This repository is not only a note for the author, but also a good appetizer for the following Machine-Learning beginners. The description, data and source codes are all uploaded to this repository. Follow this program, you can learn how to: <br><br>
-------------------------<br>
### **1. Build a logistic regression classifier, and treat the binary classification problem.**<br><br>
### **2. Build a naive Bayes spam classifier to classify the spam emails.**<br><br>
### **3. Recognize handwritten digit images of MNIST with Neural Network algorithm.** <br>
-------------------------<br>

After the above study, you can gain the knowledge of common machine learning algorithms and the way to solve problems through machine learning.<br><br>
